## Features

- **Multi-user support**: JupyterHub can support multiple users, each with their own Jupyter notebook server.
- **Authentication**: Supports various authentication methods, including OAuth, LDAP, and more.
- **Customizable**: Highly customizable to fit the needs of different organizations.
- **Scalable**: Can be deployed on a single server or scaled to a large cluster.
