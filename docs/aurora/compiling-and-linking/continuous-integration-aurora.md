# Continuous Integration Aurora

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests. Aurora's CI system is designed to ensure that code changes are reliable and ready for deployment.

## Key Features

- **Automated Testing**: Every code change triggers a suite of tests to ensure that the new code does not break existing functionality.
- **Build Automation**: Code is automatically compiled and built, reducing the risk of human error.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Once the code passes all tests, it can be automatically deployed to production environments.

## Getting Started

To get started with Aurora's CI system, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Your Environment**: Ensure you have the necessary tools and permissions to access the CI system.
2. **Write Tests**: Before integrating your code, write tests to verify its functionality.
3. **Commit Code**: Use version control to commit your code changes to the repository.
4. **Monitor Builds**: Check the CI dashboard to monitor the status of your builds and tests.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the CI system, consider the following steps:

- **Check Logs**: Review the build and test logs for any error messages.
- **Consult Documentation**: Refer to the [Aurora CI Documentation](https://www.example.com/aurora-ci-docs) for troubleshooting tips.
- **Contact Support**: If you are unable to resolve the issue, contact the support team for assistance.

## Conclusion

Aurora's CI system is a powerful tool that helps ensure code quality and reliability. By integrating frequently and using automated tests, developers can catch issues early and maintain a high standard of code.
