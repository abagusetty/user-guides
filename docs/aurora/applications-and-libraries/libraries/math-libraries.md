# Math Libraries

Math libraries are essential tools for performing complex mathematical computations efficiently. They provide a wide range of functions and algorithms that can be used in various applications, from scientific research to engineering and finance.

## Popular Math Libraries

Here are some popular math libraries used in different programming languages:

### Python

- **NumPy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things a powerful N-dimensional array object.
- **SciPy**: Builds on NumPy and provides a large number of higher-level functions that operate on numpy arrays and are useful for different types of scientific and engineering applications.
- **SymPy**: A Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible to be comprehensible and easily extensible.

### C++

- **Eigen**: A C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms.
- **Armadillo**: A high-quality C++ linear algebra library, aiming towards a good balance between speed and ease of use.

### Java

- **Apache Commons Math**: A library of lightweight, self-contained mathematics and statistics components addressing the most common problems not available in the Java programming language.
- **JAMA**: A basic linear algebra package for Java.
