# Single node "GPU-Peak" benchmarks

> This work was done on a pre-production supercomputer with early versions of the Aurora software development kit

This page aims to give you a high-level overview of key performance numbers for a single Aurora node. 

- We are providing both 1 Tile and Full Node numbers.
  - The Full Node numbers are the Weak scaling version of the single node one.
  - The Full Node numbers have been achieved by one Rank per Tile, 12 Ranks.
- All benchmarks' source code and launch options are included so you can tweak them as needed.
   - We are not exhaustive. Please assume we cherry-picked the correct size to get the best numbers.
   - We will *not* compare the results to some ‚Äútheoretical‚Äù value.  Theoretical values are full of assumptions, and we want to keep this page short.
   - We will *not* compare the results to other hardware. Feel free to do it yourself üôÇ
   - To improve reproducibility, only the ‚Äúbest‚Äù numbers are reported (e.g., we take the minimum time of repetition step). When doing "real" science, please perform better statistical analysis.
   - The code will use a mixture of OpenMP and SYCL in C++ (sorry, Fortran, Python, and Level Zero lovers).

The asterisk (`*`) Means run on sunspot...
