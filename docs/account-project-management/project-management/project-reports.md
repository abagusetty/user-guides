The Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) is required to report the progress and scientific accomplishments of all peer-reviwed projects. 

PIs of INCITE, ALCC, and ADSP projects are required to complete quarterly reports and a final end-of-project (EOY/EOP) report.

## Due dates
### 2021-2022 ADSP quarterly and the EOY reports are:
- August 1, 2021 (Q1)
- November 1, 2021 (Q2)
- February 1, 2022 (Q3)
- May 1, 2022 (EOY) or June 15, 2022 (entire allocation period - EOP)

## Penalties
If a quarterly report is more than 30 days late:
- The ability to submit jobs for the PI and users of the late project will be disabled.

If a quarterly report is more than 90 days late:
- The PI and users of the late project will have their accounts disabled.

These penalties will be removed within three business days after the late quarterly or EOY report is submitted.

## Appeals
A PI or user may appeal a project or account suspension to the ALCF Director by a request to support at alcf.anl.gov.

## Report Templates
Templates for the quarterly and the EOY reports can be found at the links on the bottom of this page.

Please modify the filename to replace PINAME with the last name of the PI of the ADSP project, ALLOCATION to ADSP, and YEAR to the corresponding calendar year.  For quarterly reports, please replace the X in the filename with the quarter number.

For example, for a project with PI 'Joe Smith' that is submitting the quarterly report for the first quarter in 2021-2022 cycle for ADSP, the filename will be Smith_ADSP_Q1.docx.

For an EOY report, replace YEARS with the years associated with your allocation. For example, an ADSP 2021-2022 project with PI 'Joe Smith' would have a filename of Smith_ADSP_2021-2022_EOY.docx.
