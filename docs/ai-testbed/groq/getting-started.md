## Allocations

TODO confirm all this
Available for Directorâ€™s Discretionary(DD) allocations.
[https://www.alcf.anl.gov/science/directors-discretionary-allocation-program](Allocation Request Form)
Allocations also available under the [https://www.alcf.anl.gov/science/adsp-allocation-program](INCITE), [https://www.alcf.anl.gov/science/adsp-allocation-program](ALCC), and [https://www.alcf.anl.gov/science/adsp-allocation-program](ALCF DataScience) programs.

## Accounts

If you do not have an ALCF account, request one here: [https://accounts.alcf.anl.gov/#/home](ALCF Account and Project Management)

## Setup

Connection to a Groq node is a two-step process.

### Log in to a homes node

The first step is to ssh from a local machine to the login node.

Follow the instructions here to access GCE login nodes: [https://help.cels.anl.gov/docs/linux/ssh/](https://help.cels.anl.gov/docs/linux/ssh/)
If you have not already done so, you will need to create a ssh key pair and add ONLY the public key to your cels account at [https://accounts.cels.anl.gov](https://accounts.cels.anl.gov). Key type ed25519 is preferred, but not required.

Verify that this full ssh command works, after editing it to use your argonne username:
```bash
ssh -J yourargonneusername@logins.cels.anl.gov yourargonneusername@homes.cels.anl.gov
```
You can shorten the command line by adding the following to your `~/.ssh/config`, edited to use your argonne username.
```console
Host *.cels.anl.gov !logins.cels.anl.gov
ProxyJump yourargonneusername@logins.cels.anl.gov
```

Then this should work.
```bash
ssh yourargonneusername@homes.cels.anl.gov
```

You will automatically be logged in if you have done this before. Use
the ssh "-v" switch to debug ssh problems.

### Log in to a Graphcore Node

Once you are on a homes node, ssh to one of the Groqrack nodes, which are numbered 1-9.

```bash
ssh groq-r01-gn-01.ai.alcf.anl.gov
# or
ssh groq-r01-gn-09.ai.alcf.anl.gov
# or any node with hostname of form groq-r01-gn-0[1-9].ai.alcf.anl.gov
```
