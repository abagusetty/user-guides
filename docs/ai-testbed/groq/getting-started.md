## Accounts

If you do not have an ALCF account, request one here: [https://accounts.alcf.anl.gov/#/home](ALCF Account and Project Management)

## Setup

Connection to a Groq node is a two-step process.

### Log in to a login node

The first step is to ssh from a local machine to the login node.

Verify that this full ssh command works, after editing it to use your argonne username:
```bash
ssh yourargonneusername@groq.ai.alcf.anl.gov
```


You will automatically be logged in if you have done this before. Use
the ssh "-v" switch to debug ssh problems.

### Log in to a Groq compute node

Once you are on a login node, ssh to one of the Groqrack nodes, which are numbered 1-9.

```bash
ssh groq-r01-gn-01.ai.alcf.anl.gov
# or
ssh groq-r01-gn-09.ai.alcf.anl.gov
# or any node with hostname of form groq-r01-gn-0[1-9].ai.alcf.anl.gov
```
