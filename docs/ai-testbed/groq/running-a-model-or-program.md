# Running a Model/Program

## Job submission and queuing

Groq jobs in the AI Testbed's groqrack are currently not managed by a job scheduler. [PBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Batch_System)-based job scheduling is under development. 

## Login nodes

Jobs are launched from any groq node. <br>
If you expect a loss of an internet connection for any reason, for long-running jobs we suggest logging into a specific groq node and using either **screen** or **tmux** to create persistent command line sessions.  For details use:

```bash
man screen
# or
man tmux
```
or online man pages: [screen](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/en/man1/screen.1.html), [tmux](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/en/man1/tmux.1.html)

## Running jobs on Groq nodes

### Groqflow

Groqflow is the simplest way to port applications running inference to groq. The groqflow github repo includes many sample applications.</br>
See [GroqFlow](https://github.com/groq/groqflow/tree/main).

### Clone the Groqflow github repo

Clone the groqflow github repo and change current directory to the clone:
```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/groq/groqflow.git
cd groqflow
```

### Groqflow conda environments

Create a groqflow conda environment, and activate it.<br>
Note: Similar install instructions are in `~/groqflow/docs/install.md` or [GroqFlowâ„¢ Installation Guide](https://github.com/groq/groqflow/blob/main/docs/install.md)<br>
The conda enviroment should be reinstalled whenever new groqflow code is pulled from the groqflow github; redo just the pip install steps.

#### Install conda
If conda is not already installed:
```bash
rm Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh*
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
# answer y/yes to all prompts
# exit ssh session, then start a new ssh session
exit
```
#### Create and activate a groqflow conda environment
Create a groqflow conda environment and activate it
```bash
export PYTHON_VERSION=3.8.13
conda create -n groqflow python=$PYTHON_VERSION
conda activate groqflow
```

#### Install groqflow into the groqflow conda environment
Execute the following commands to install groqflow into the activated groqflow conda environment
```bash
# Alter this if you have cloned groqflow to some other location.
cd ~/groqflow
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .  --user
pushd . 
cd demo_helpers
pip install -e . --user
popd
```

For any new ssh session, to use groqfloq,
```bash
conda activate groqflow
```
Alternative, the activation command can be put in .bashrc.
Note: Always use a personal conda environment when installing packages on groq nodes; otherwise they can get installed into ~/.local and can cause problems when your shared home directory is used on other systems.

### Running a groqflow sample
Each groqflow sample directory in the `~/groqflow/proof_points` tree has a README.md describing the sample and how to run it.

#### Activate your Groqflow conda environment
```console
conda activate groqflow
```
#### Run a sample
```bash
cd ~/groqflow/proof_points/natural_language_processing/minilm
python minilmv2.py
```



<!---
(0) remove the contents of .local, but preserve the directory path ~/.local/bin (be careful; some apps put stuff in .local)
(1) remove conda completely, including the stuff at the end of .bashrc. Then logout and back in
- rm -r ~/.conda
- edit .bashrc
- exit ssh session, start a new ssh session
(2) clone groqflow if it hasn't already been cloned:
- git clone https://github.com/groq/groqflow.git
- cd groqflow
- rm Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh*
- wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
- bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
 - answer y/yes to all prompts
- exit ssh session, start a new ssh session
(3) create a groqflow conda environment and activate it
- export PYTHON_VERSION=3.8.13
- conda create -n groqflow python=$PYTHON_VERSION
- conda activate groqflow
(4) install groqflow
- pip install --upgrade pip
- pip install tqdm #[NOT SURE THIS IS NEEDED] ETA NOT NEEDED! Already installed.
- pip install -e .  --user
- pushd . 
- cd demo_helpers
- pip install -e . --user
- popd
