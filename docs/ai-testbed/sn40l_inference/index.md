# System Overview

## Introduction

The SambaStack SN40L system is architected around Reconfigurable Dataflow Unit (RDU) processors. The AI Testbed's SambaNova SN40L cluster consists of two SambaRacks, each rack featuring 16 SL40L RDUs. ML models running on ANL's SambaStack cluster are exposed as openai-api-compatible endpoints; an endpoint can contain multiple independently usable models, 

Below are some of the links to SambaNova documentation.
