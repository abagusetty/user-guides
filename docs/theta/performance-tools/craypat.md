# CrayPat
## Introduction
The Cray Performance Measurement and Analysis Tools (or CrayPat) are a suite of utilities that enable the user to capture and analyze performance data generated during the execution of a program on a Cray system. It includes CrayPat, CrayPat-lite, Cray Apprentices2, Reveal and the Cray PAPI components.

- Manual pages (after module is loaded): ```$ man perftools-lite```
- Detailed information about the output report: ```$ man pat_report```

## CrayPat-lite
This section focuses on CrayPat-lite, the simplified, easy-to-use version of the Cray Performance Measurement and Analysis Tool set. CrayPat-lite provides basic performance analysis information automatically, with a minimum of the user interaction. While CrayPat provides more functionalities. 

**1. Environment Setup**
To use CrayPat-lite, the appropriate module should be loaded, and darshan should be unloaded.
```
$ module unload darshan

$ module load perftools-lite
```
**Note:** 
- Darshan needs to be unloaded since it uses environment variables which CrayPat-lite also uses.
- Note that the perftools-base module should already be listed under “module list” If not, load perftools base with “module load perftools-base”. This provides access to man pages and help system, and does not instrument code. (Should be loaded by default.)
- “module load perftools-lite” loads performance instrumentation module, and will instrument programs when they are compiled.

**Tip:** To verify that the correct modules are loaded, run "module list" and check that perftools-lite and perftools-base are loaded and that darshan is not present.

**2. Compile the Code to Use CrayPat-lite**
Rebuild code as usual. When the program is built, there should be output like below, noting that CrayPat-lite was used.
```
$ make clean 
$ make ftn -O3 -qopt-report=5 -g -align array64byte test.f90 -o test 
INFO: creating the CrayPat-instrumented executable 'test' (sample_profile) ...OK
```
**Tip:** To verify that the executable was instrumented with CrayPat-lite, use the following command to search the executable for CrayPat strings:
```
$ strings test | grep "CrayPat/X" 
CrayPat/X: Version 7.0.0 Revision 5c29ce2 12/11/17 15:26:24
```
**3. Run the Code**
Run the code as usual
```
$ qsub -n 8 -t 30 -A project jobscript.sh

$ cat jobscript.sh

#!/bin/bash

aprun -n 512 -N 64 test
```
**4. Output**
After the code finishes executing, CrayPat-lite output should be printed to stdout (likely at the end of the jobid.output file). More output will be saved in .rpt files and .ap2 files, which might be under a new directory created in the directory the run occurred in.

An example of output is shown below. Note that it is truncated after Table 1, since this is just for illustration purposes.
```
$ cat 309226.output

```
By default, the sampling rate for CrayPat-lite is 100 times per second (or once every 104 microseconds) (check the runtime environment variable ```PAT_RT_SAMPLING_INTERVAL``` (given in microseconds)to verify the sampling rate).

Samp% is the percent of total samples taken which occurred in the given routine, averaged over all processes.

Samp is the number of samples which occurred in the given routine, averaged over all processes.

Imb. Samp is (maximum number of samples taken in given routine by one process - number of samples taken in given routine, averaged over all processes).

Imb. Samp% is (Imb. Samp) / (maximum number of samples taken in given routine by one process) * (number of processes / (number of processes - 1)) * 100%

Based on the above, 48.7% of total samples occurred in the genral_ routine, averaged over all processes, and the most samples taken in genral_ by one process process differed from the average by 338.9 samples. (If it was perfectly load balanced, Imb. Samp would be 0.) Additionally, 21.1% samples occurred in BLAS routines, averaged over all processes.

We can also see that this was run on 8 KNL nodes with 64 MPI ranks/node, for a total of 512 MPI processes.

Details explaining the output and how to get more information can be found in the references, training assets and the man page (above).

## CrayPat
CrayPat supports two categories of performance analysis experiments: tracing experiments, which count some event such as the number of times a specific system call is executed, and asynchronous (sampling) experiments, which capture values at specified time intervals or when a specified counter overflows.

**1. Environmental Setup**
To use CrayPat, unload darshan module and load perftools-base and perftools modules. 
```
jkwack@thetamom2:~/CrayPat_Test> module unload darshan
jkwack@thetamom2:~/CrayPat_Test> module load perftools-base perftools
```
**2. Build your application and instrument it with pat_build**
The pat_build command is the instrumenting component of the CrayPat performance analysis tool. After loading the perftools-base and perftools instrumentation modules and recompiling the program, use the pat_build command to instrument the program for data capture. There are several ways to instrument your application as follows:

For the default Automatic Profiling Analysis: ```$ pat_build a.out```

For predefined trace groups: ```$ pat_build -g tracegroup a.out```

For enabling tracing and the CrayPat API: ```$ pat_build -w a.out```

For instrumenting a single function: ```$ pat_build -T tracefunc a.out```

For instrumenting a list of functions: ```$ pat_build -t tracefile a.out```

The pat_build command is documented in more detail in the pat_build(1) man page. For additional information and examples, see pat_help build.

The following is an example on an interactive job mode on Theta:
```
jkwack@thetamom2:~/CrayPat_Test> ftn -dynamic -Ofast -fopenmp test.f90 -o test
WARNING: PerfTools is saving object files from a temporary directory into directory '/home/jkwack/.craypat/test/70303'
```

```
jkwack@thetamom2:~/CrayPat_Test> pat_build test
jkwack@thetamom2:~/CrayPat_Test> ls -al test*
-rwxr-xr-x 1 jkwack users   46568 Mar  4 19:57 test
-rw-r--r-- 1 jkwack users    6143 Mar  4 19:57 test.f90
-rwxr-xr-x 1 jkwack users 1399496 Mar  4 19:59 test+pat
```

**3. Run your instrumented binary**
Run your instrumented executable binary ending with +pat with your usual runtime parameters.
```
jkwack@thetamom2:~/CrayPat_Test> aprun -n 64 ./test+pat 4096 100

```

**4. Post-processing with pat_report**
The pat_report command is the text reporting component of the Cray Performance Analysis Tools suite. After using the pat_build command to instrument the program, set the run time environment variables as desired, and then execute the program, use the pat_report command to generate text reports from the resulting data and export the data for use in other applications.

The pat_report command is documented in detail in the pat_report(1) man page. Additional information can be found in the online help system under pat_help report.

The following is for the above example on an interactive mode on Theta:
```
kwack@thetamom2:~/CrayPat_Test> pat_report -o test.CrayPat_report.txt test+pat+9755-3826s

Processing step 1 of 9

Suggested trace options file:   test+pat+9755-3826s/build-options.apa

```

See test.CrayPat_report.txt file for the detailed performance data:

General table notes:


    The default notes for a table do not account for the effects

    of additional command-line options, but the detailed notes

    produced by the -v option do account for them.

    

    An imbalance metric in a line is based on values in main threads

    across multiple ranks, or on values across all threads, as applicable.

    

    An imbalance percent in a line is relative to the maximum value

    for that line across ranks or threads, as applicable.

**5. In-depth Analysis: Using Cray Apprentice2**
Cray Apprentice2 is a GUI tool for visualizing and manipulating the performance analysis data captured during program execution. After using pat_report to open the initial .xf data file(s) and generate the .ap2 file(s), use Cray Apprentice2 to open and explore the .ap2 file(s) in further detail.

The following is an example on a login node on Theta:
```
jkwack@thetalogin5:~> module unload darshan
jkwack@thetalogin5:~> module load perftools-base perftools
jkwack@thetalogin5:~> app2
```
