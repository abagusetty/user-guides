# Accounts Policy
All holders of user accounts must abide by all appropriate Argonne Leadership Computing Facility and Argonne National Laboratory computing usage policies. 

These are described at the time of the account request and include requirements such as using a sufficiently strong password, appropriate use of the system, and so on. Any user not following these requirements will have their account disabled.

Furthermore, ALCF resources are intended to be used as a computing resource for specific computational science or engineering work, not as a general-purpose computing system. 

If someone is using the system extensively but not carrying out any computational activities, their account could be disabled.
