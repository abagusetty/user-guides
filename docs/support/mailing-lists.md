## Mailing lists

All notifications regarding system outages and preventative maintenace schedules are sent to appropriate system mailing lists. 

Users are auto-subscribed to the relevant system mailing list(s) when they **first** gain access to that system. The user's primary email is subscribed to the list(s).

You will need to re-subscribe if you either:
* Unsubscribed from the mailing list(s) and wish to rejoin, or
* Would like to subscribe a different email address instead

### Manual subscription/unsubscription

To manually subscribe or unsubscribe, go to https://lists.alcf.anl.gov/mailman/listinfo/{replae-ALCF-system-name}-notify and follow the instructions. **Note** : you must replace {replace-ALCF-system-name} with the appropriate compute system you have access to (such as polaris, crux, aurora, sophia, etc.).
