# Polaris System Updates

## 2024-04-22

We will have a multi-day outage on Polaris to upgrade management software to HPCM 1.10 from April 22-25, 2024.
These version changes will take place with the upgrade to HPCM 1.10:

- HPE Cray Programming Environment (CPE) 23.12
- NVIDIA SDK 23.9
- NVIDIA driver version 535.154.05

We intend to keep Grand and Eagle operational during the upgrade. 
Users should use Globus to access their project data.
